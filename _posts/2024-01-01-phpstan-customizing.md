### PHPStan tailored to your needs

Do you need help with PHPStan in some form?
You can get me - one of the top contributors to PHPStan or related static analysis tooling - to support your team or project(s).

I have [plenty of experience](https://staabm.github.io/archive.html#phpstan) in [contributing changes to PHPStan core](https://staabm.github.io/2023/12/07/contribution-summary-2023.html), or implementing custom extensions.

As of now, I am available for hire to make the tooling fit your needs.


#### Fixing blockers

You are blocked by a reported issue in PHPStan or related tooling?
Your projects would benefit from getting certain features implemented in PHPStan?

I can fix bugs or implement features that are blocking you to get the most out of PHPStan.


#### Investigate performance issues

PHPStan/Rector is running slow in your project? You need help to get a faster feedback loop?
Let me analyse your case at hand and investigate possible solutions.


#### Specific needs / tailored integration

I can help you build custom extensions and/or rules to seamlessly integrate PHPStan into your framework, libraries, and/or development workflow.
