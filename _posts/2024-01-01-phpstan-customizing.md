### PHPStan Customizing - Tailored to your needs

Do you need help with PHPStan in some form?
You can get me - one of the top contributors to PHPStan or related static analysis tooling - to support your team or projects.

As of now, I am available for hire to make the tooling fit your needs.


#### Fixing blockers

You are blocked by a reported issue in PHPStan or related tooling?
Your projects would benefit from getting certain features implemented in PHPStan?

Sponsoring me to fix bugs or implement features that are blocking you to get the most out of PHPStan.


#### Investigate performance issues

PHPStan is running slow in your project? You are not sure if it's PHPStan or your codebase?
I will analyse your case at hand and investigate possible solutions.


#### Specific needs / tailored integration

I can help you build custom extensions and/or rules to seamlessly integrate PHPStan into your framework, libraries, and/or development workflow.
