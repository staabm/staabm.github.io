### Readable end-to-end tests for PHPStan with bashunit

For a long time in the PHPStan repository, we have isolated, highly-parallel end-to-end tests which are written in bash utilizing GitHub Actions.
The design and initial implemenation - as far as I know - has been done by Ondřej Mirtes.

I don't know any other project doing end-to-end tests the way it is done in PHPStan.
Since I have recently added [`bashunit`](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/) to the end-to-end tests, I wanted to share some insights and the benefits of this approach.

NOTE: This post is only about end-to-end tests, not about unit tests or integration tests which would require a largely different setup.

### What's a end-to-end test?

In the context of this article a PHPStan end-to-end test runs the compiled phar-file on the command line
and asserts expectations based on the cli exit-code or the generated command output.

Example:

```bash
cd e2e/different-php-parser2 # change to test-directory
composer install # install test-dependencies
../../phpstan analyse -l 5 src # run the precompiled PHPStan phar
```

When these commands are executed within a GitHub Action, the test is considered successful when all commands exit with a `0` exit-code.
As soon as a single command exits with a non-zero exit-code, the GitHub Action will stop executing and report an error - similar to how `set -e` works in bash scripts.


### GitHub Action based "data-provider"

Putting such a test into a GitHub Action is a great way to run it in a controlled environment.
Every action run is isolated from others and depending on your GitHub pricing-plan the runner environment will execute even hundreds of these tests in parallel:

```
name: "E2E Tests"

on:
  pull_request:
     # … whatever event you want to trigger the tests

jobs:
  e2e-tests:
    name: "E2E tests"
    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"
    timeout-minutes: 60

    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - script: |
            cd e2e/different-php-parser2 # change to test-directory
            composer install # install test-dependencies
            ../../phpstan analyse -l 5 src # run the precompiled PHPStan phar

          # script: | … next test

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout" # checkout of the phpstan repository contains the test-source and a precompiled phar
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: "Install PHP"
        uses: "shivammathur/setup-php@v2"
        with:
          coverage: "none"
          php-version: "8.1"

      - name: "Test"
        run: {% raw %}${{ matrix.script }}{% endraw %}
```

Each end-to-end test in this case is a simple directory, which can contain anything a regular project could contain, like a `composer.json`, a `phpstan.neon` or a `phpunit.xml.dist` file.
For inspiration: Any [subfolder below `e2e/` in the PHPStan repository](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/tree/1.11.x/e2e) represents a single end-to-end test.


Since we are using a regular [GitHub Action matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) in this scenario, we can easily add more test-parameters to the mixed to cover other use-cases:

```
name: "E2E Tests"

on:
  pull_request:
     # … whatever event you want to trigger the tests

jobs:
  e2e-tests:
    name: "E2E tests"
    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"
    timeout-minutes: 60

    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - php-version: "8.1"
            script: |
            cd e2e/different-php-parser2
            composer install
            ../../phpstan analyse -l 5 src

          - php-version: "7.4"
            script: |
            cd e2e/another-test
            ../../phpstan analyse -l 5 src

          # script: | … next test

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout" # checkout of the phpstan repository contains the test-source and a precompiled phar
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: "Install PHP"
        uses: "shivammathur/setup-php@v2"
        with:
          coverage: "none"
          php-version: "{% raw %}${{ matrix.php-version }}{% endraw %}"

      - name: "Test"
        run: {% raw %}${{ matrix.script }}{% endraw %}
```

Using such parameters one could easily:
- use a different operating system per test
- use different PHP versions per test
- use different PHP extensions per test
- …


### Adding `bashunit` to the mix

I recently stumbled over a end-to-end test use-case, in which I needed to assert certain error-message within the output of the PHPStan command.

My initial take on the reproducer was:

```
cd e2e/trait-caching
../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/
patch -b data/TraitOne.php < TraitOne.patch
OUTPUT=$(../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/ || true)
echo "$OUTPUT"
[ $(echo "$OUTPUT" | wc -l) -eq 1 ]
grep 'Method TraitsCachingIssue\\TestClassUsingTrait::doBar() should return stdClass but returns Exception.' <<< "$OUTPUT"
```

This particular test had a few problem, which make them hard to read, especially for people not used to bash.
- what is `[ $(echo "$OUTPUT" | wc -l) -eq 1 ]` doing?
- PHPStan error messages contain all kind of characters, and some of them need special escaping in bash - e.g. doubling the `\`.
- the `grep` command using input redirection with `<<< "$OUTPUT"`, which handles multi line strings looks strange for the untrained eye.


In the next iteration to improve the test, I added a small [`assert.sh` wrapper script](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/51fe9c57222b3040368d4c3e2fa397d6ae1580ef/e2e/assert.sh) around `bashunit`, which allowed us to call the bashunit-assertion functions from the cli:

```
cd e2e/trait-caching
../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/
patch -b data/TraitOne.php < TraitOne.patch
OUTPUT=$(../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/ || true)
echo "$OUTPUT"
../assert.sh equals `echo "$OUTPUT" | wc -l` 1
../assert.sh contains 'Method TraitsCachingIssue\TestClassUsingTrait::doBar() should return stdClass but returns Exception.' "$OUTPUT"
```

Note the easily readable assertions without the need to escape certain characters.

At this point we got in contact with the `bashunit` maintainers, which immediately helped us with a few problems in the initial setup.
They also liked the `assert.sh` script so much, that they natively integrated the feature natively into `bashunit` as of version 0.13 ([Release Post](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/blog/2024-06-21-phpstan-integration)).

So the final test-case in the end looks like:

```
cd e2e/trait-caching
../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/
patch -b data/TraitOne.php < TraitOne.patch
OUTPUT=$(../../bin/phpstan analyze --no-progress --level 8 --error-format raw data/ || true)
echo "$OUTPUT"
../bashunit -a line_count 1 "$OUTPUT"
../bashunit -a contains 'Method TraitsCachingIssue\TestClassUsingTrait::doBar() should return stdClass but returns Exception.' "$OUTPUT"
```
