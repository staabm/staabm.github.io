To celebrate [Maintainer Month](https://github.blog/2022-06-24-thank-you-to-our-maintainers/), GitHub has invested an additional $500,000 to help sponsor the open source projects that it depends on.

## GitHub Maintainer Month

I was selected to be one of those 900 people across the globe to get a one time sponsorship from GitHub ü§©.

> We rely on the work of hundreds of open source projects to build and run GitHub, npm, GitHub Desktop, GitHub Mobile, GitHub CLI, and all the software that we maintain. Therefore, today we are distributing $500,000 across the over 900 maintainers of our identified open source dependencies who are also signed up with GitHub Sponsors. From the U.S. to Japan to Brazil, if you‚Äôre one of the people or projects we identified then you will get a confirmation about the sponsorship before the end of June.
 
It means a lot to me üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è.

[I put a lot of work in the open source space](https://staabm.github.io/recent-work.html), as I really love the idea of working on things in the open in my freetime and make it available to anyone. Thank you.
