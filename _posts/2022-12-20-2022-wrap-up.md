2022 is nearly over. We are looking back to get an idea of what happened in the past year.

## #GitHubUnwrapped

On twitter I stumbled over the [#GitHubUnwrapped](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GitHubUnwrapped) hashtag.
People are sharing a summary of contributions made with [a cool small tool](https://www.githubunwrapped.com/).

So let's have a look what the utility thinks about my 2022.

3181 contributions in 2022â€¦ I think this means I don't have much hobbies outside of coding ðŸ˜….

I spent [most of my time on PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Astaabm+), or one of my tools that are related to it.
If you are interested in the details, I have [blogged](https://staabm.github.io/archive.html#phpstan) about [some](https://staabm.github.io/archive.html#phpstan-dba) of [these](https://staabm.github.io/archive.html#rexstan) [contributions](https://staabm.github.io/archive.html#redaxo).

Less surprising is that I mostly work with PHP. It seems I also did some stuff with SCSS but I can't remember what that was.
I am writing code for at least 20 years now, in a lot of different languages.
I started the career with PHP, and thats also what I use lately. Really like the language, tools and the community.

I feel opening issues on projects is a very important part of the open source ecosystem.
People talk about their needs so that maintainers get an idea, how their projects are used and which problems are tackled with them.
Its an important way to get feedback.

This is another interesting image. It tells me that I maybe should open less issues and work more on closing already open ones ðŸ˜‡?
Surely not all my opened issues need to be resolved - not all are worth the effort or just describe a rough idea.
On the other hand we can see that since I have contributed a lot, I have closed/worked on other people issues - so in the end I am fine with the current ratio.

Anyone who's working with me on a daily basis knows that my workday starts a few hours later than it does for most people.
The statistic suggests that I commit a lot right before lunch. Might be worth it to prioritize my most important tasks into this timeslot.

I love pull requests. Especially working on tooling is one of my favorite activities. I am not that guy which builds the frontend or end user feature stuff.
Usually my daily work is about removing code, doing refactorings. Discussing with the product owner whether existing features are worth maintaining is another tasks I enjoy.

Very likely I would have chosen a different list of pull requests, in contrast to what #GitHubUnwrapped selected. Maybe thats stuff for another blog post.

If you are curious, have a look at the [final #GitHubUnwrapped video result](https://www.githubunwrapped.com/staabm)

## Thank you

Let me finally say thank you to all the people who work with me in the open source space, no matter in which form you support a project.
I would also thank everyone which supports my work by sponsoring me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/staabm).

Your support keeps me motivated to continue my work - even on weekends or after I already worked 8-9 hours in my day job.
