Let's have a look at my personal highlights of 547 merged pull requests across 80 open-source projects in 2024:
- [A `mixed` type PHPStan journey](https://staabm.github.io/2024/11/26/phpstan-mixed-types.html)
- [`@param-out` implementation](https://phpstan.org/blog/phpstan-1-9-0-with-phpdoc-asserts-list-type#parameter-type-assigned-by-reference) in PHPStan
- [type inference for regular expressions](https://phpstan.org/blog/phpstan-1-12-road-to-phpstan-2-0#general-availability-of-precise-type-inference-for-regular-expressions) in PHPStan, see also [my blog post](https://staabm.github.io/2024/07/05/array-shapes-for-preg-match-matches.html)
- [`@require-extends` and `@require-implements`](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdocs-basics#enforcing-class-inheritance-for-interfaces-and-traits) in PHPStan, see also [my blog post](https://staabm.github.io/2024/01/15/phpstan-require-extends-implements.html)
- [Dead code detection for PHP_* constants](https://staabm.github.io/2024/11/14/phpstan-php-version-narrowing.html)
- Took part in the [PHPUnit Codesprint in Munich](https://staabm.github.io/2024/10/19/phpunit-codesprint-munich.html)
- phpstan-todo-by - check for [TODO comments with expiration](https://staabm.github.io/2023/12/17/phpstan-todo-by-published.html)
- Endless pull requests to improve performance and efficiency in PHPStan and Rector
- Hundreds of bug fixes in PHPStan, Rector, PHPUnit, Composerâ€¦

In a recent blog post you can in addition find my [current plan for the upcoming months](https://staabm.github.io/2024/11/28/phpstan-php-version-in-scope.html).
I am still looking for [financial support for this effort](https://github.com/sponsors/staabm).
