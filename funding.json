      "description": "My new focus area will be improving the PHPStan story around multi php-version supporting code. This means focusing on stuff which is different between PHP versions.\n\nIf you want to cover your codebase cross several PHP versions, you need to set up a CI matrix with different PHP versions. You also need multiple PHPStan baselines to ignore errors which are only relevant for a specific PHP version. Such a setup brings additional complexity not everyone is willing to deal with.\n\nIn my experience most projects set up PHPStan only for a few PHP versions and ignore the rest, which leaves a lot of potential errors undetected.\n\nLet me work on PHPStan to iterate on this use-case so your next PHP version upgrade will be easier and contain less hurdles.
